# CHIP-8_Emulator
Working from the codeslinger article found here - http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/chip8.html

## What is CHIP-8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language for 8-bit developed to make programming video games easy on these computers.  
-> These games included home versions of "Pong", "Space Invaders" etc for the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 computers.

## Why?
Getting started with programming emulators using C++.  
-> Good gateway due to relative simplicity, only 4KB of memory and 36 instructions.
